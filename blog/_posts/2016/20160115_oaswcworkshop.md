title: First Open astronomy - Software Carpentry workshop

date: 2016-01-15
----------------

Last week (11-15th January 2016) saw the first Open Astronomy workshop held at The University of Sheffield for the UK astronomy and solar physics communities. The first two days of the [workshop](http://openastronomy.org/2016-01-11-Sheffield/) consisted of the core syllabus of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/), covering git, bash and an introduction to programming with Python. The last three days provided an introduction to carrying out research in astronomy using Python. The attendees were mostly PhD students in Astrophysics from the University of Sheffield, however there were also representation of other fields (mathematics, medicine, ecology), from other universities (St. Andrews, Reading) and at different stages in their careers (post-docs).

The workshop was taught by four different instructors ([Sam](https://github.com/CyclingNinja), [Drew](https://github.com/drewleonard42), [Stuart](https://github.com/cadair) and [David](https://github.com/dpshelio)) with the help of [Tom](https://github.com/astrofrog/) (an astropy developer) on Thursday.
We all brought different expertise and shared the teaching out to keep the workshop lively over a gruelling five days none of us taught more than three hours in one go, and we alternated days between teaching and assisting.
We used the red-green post-it technique suggested by software carpentry as a way to know how people were getting on during the sessions, also, for every session the learners were asked to use these post-it notes to give us feedback on the session (green for something good you've learnt, red for something that can be improved).
This not just helped us for the next workshop, but it also helped to the next instructor that day!

As usual there were some software setup issues at the beginning of the week, however we were very close!
Only one person from the whole class has troubles with the Jupyter notebook - it simply was not able to execute any command within. We didn't manage to fix the problem, but probably it was the oldest laptop (running Windows 7) in the class.
Beside that case, we come across a couple of other problems in another windows machine, in one of them `git log` was blocking the screen and one other person's machine could not open the text editor (Notepad++ in this case) when executing `commit` (or `merge` with the default message).

Each day we updated the official repository with lesson templates in jupyter notebooks format, where the explanation of the class were available, and the code cells were empty for them to fill while following the lecture. 
In this way everyone had to `fork` our repository on github, then `pull` at the start of every session from `upstream` and `push` at the end to their `origin`.
Therefore getting the basics on how to work in a such an scenario where the repositories are updated at different times.
In the other hand, thanks to the visualisations in github we can see how all [these fork evolved](https://github.com/OpenAstronomy/2016-01-11_Sheffield_Notes/network).

We found a bug on SunPy during one of the sessions, and we use the opportunity to teach what to do in these cases: fill an issue in github and provide the information needed so the developers can replicate such error.

Mind blows!
 - table to latex!
 - readline works very easily
 - people trying to use in their own data
 - coordinates discussions..
 
If you want a workshop... if no one else can help... and if you can find them... maybe you can hire... The SD2-Team.
