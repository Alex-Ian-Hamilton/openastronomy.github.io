A major way OpenAstronomy aims to work together is through Google Summer of Code.
We are applying as an organization for the 2015 GSoC.

Student applications to OpenAstronomy projects will follow the same
rules as the [Python Software Foundation] and the [GSoC Student Guide].
Our [ideas page](/gsoc2015/ideas.html) should provide you with good starting points for
your project proposal, or you can always contact us if you have your
own idea.

We will also host blogs for OpenAstronomy GSoC students on this site.
