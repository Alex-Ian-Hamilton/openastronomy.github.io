# IDEAS for OpenAstronomy

Please, if you have any issue with the following steps contact your org admin or
ask in the multi-client real-time
[chat platform we have](http://openastronomy.org/) (Thanks @Cadair!).
The steps are set up from the point of view of I have an idea, what do I need so
it's online - so the hardest steps are towards the bottom, and you read only up
to the point you feel confident.

*TLDR - Are you an expert?* Fork the repo and modify
the [template file](./_template.md) according to your idea, save it under
`_projects/YYYY/sub-org/` with a meaningful filename and do a Pull-request.

## What do I need to have an idea?

You are here, so that's the first step!

You need to have a description and a list of candidate mentors. Which requirements
do you think are needed (_e.g._, knowing c++, expertise in OOP)? How difficult
would you say it's the project? Is there already an issue related with that idea?

If you have all that then think in an attractive project title and a one line
description. Then you put all in one file as explained below.

You can make your idea with very specific milestones or as open ended as you
want. Either way is good. If it's very specific the students will know how to
write an application as you wanted, but leave less freedom for different
approaches.

## Format needed

Cool,  you've got already all the above?

All you need now is to put it in a plain text file following
the [template file](./_template.md) (you may click in raw to see how it looks).

The file is composed in two parts (separated by a `---`).
Change the text in the template keeping
special care of the structure of the yaml file and the headings on the markdown
part (_e.g._, the top level starts with a 4 level title: `####`).


## What do I do so it appears online?

Are you familiar with git/github? If you are
not [contact us](openastronomy.organization@gmail.com) and send the above file,
we will take care to put it in place.
If, in the other hand, you are feel confident with github: go ahead, fork this
repository, find the subdirectory for your sub-organisation and the year of the
project (for example, if you are submitting an astropy project, go to
`/_projects/2017/astropy`). If your organization does not exist, create it
following the form of one of the other sub-organizations. Create a pull-request
and that's it!
