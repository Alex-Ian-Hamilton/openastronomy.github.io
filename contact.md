## Get involved with OpenAstronomy

If you want to get involved with OpenAstronomy or maybe you have a project that
would like to join the collaboration, please feel free to get in touch. The
OpenAstronomy organisation has a mailing list (<a
href="mailto:openastronomy@googlegroups.com">openastronomy@googlegroups.com</a>)
which is good place to introduce yourself.

There is also an IRC channel (<a href="{{ site.irc_freenode }}#{{site.irc_channel }}">#openastronomy on freenode.net</a>),
which regularly has a number of people in it, if you want to pop in for an
astronomy related conversation.
